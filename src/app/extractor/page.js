            The Extractor is a high-durability deep-sea mining ASUV (Aquatic Synaptium Utility Vehicle)
            designed to drill into the ocean bed and retrieve valuable resources. Built with a titanium 
            chassis and powered by Synaptium, it generates a magnetic force field to withstand immense pressure 
            and protect its internals. It features a large-scale rotary drill capable of penetrating complex 
            geological formations, all monitored and adjusted via onboard AI for optimal efficiency.

               Extractor-Lite   is a cost-effective, rugged crawler built for small-scale seabed mining. Its tread-based 
              chassis provides excellent stability across uneven terrain, while the integrated mining arm and suction 
              tank system allow it to extract loose deposits efficiently. Equipped with a basic AI module, it can 
              perform semi-autonomous operations in shallow to mid-depth zones. Its affordability makes it ideal for 
              early-stage deployments and testing missions, generating steady profits per unit sold.

              Deepreach  is a high-performance, six-legged mech built for deep-sea industrial mining. Featuring an 
              advanced rotary drill and scoop system, it can handle dense geological formations. Its edge AI module 
              ensures real-time adaptive decision-making and terrain mapping, while the built-in analyzer and sorter 
              streamline resource processing. With stronger materials and an uplink-enabled comms suite, Deepreach  is 
              engineered for long missions and high-value operations â€” and offers a significantly higher profit margin.
